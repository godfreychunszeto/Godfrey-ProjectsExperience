## 1 Document Summary

Below is a list of the school projects / work experience projects I have done.

## 2 IPO on Alternative Investment Market

I have taken a part-time role supporting a property management company in their IPO on the London AIM (Alternative Investment Market).

### 2.1 Key Responsiblities

-   Coordinated due diligence
-   Developed and analysed firm financial valuation with DCF, comparable analysis, NAV methods
-   Prepared investor roadshow

### 2.2 Skills Learnt

-   Presentation skills, showed patience and understanding to concerns clients may have
-   Communication skills collaborated with colleagues of different departments
-   Attention to detail, ensured compliance with UK Corporate Governance Code

Although I cannot legally share the documents of my previous client, please see Section 3 for a similar project done on DCF valuation.

## 3 Firm Valuation

The valuation Microsoft Excel file [here](https://github.com/godfreychunszeto/Godfrey-ProjectsExperience/blob/main/3.DCF_Valuation.xls) is simpler than the one used for my IPO internship, but the general concept remains consistent.
The goal of this case study project is to find the intrinsic value of "Seven & I Holdings Co., Ltd."

### 3.1. Key Responsibilities

-   Data extraction with Bloomberg Terminal and S&P Capital IQ
-   Analysed and interpreted DCF valuation

### 3.2 Skills Learnt

-   Financial data platforms (Bloomberg Terminal and S&P Capital IQ)
-   Data collection and data visualisation with Microsoft Excel and VBA

## 4 Stock Price Simulation and Option Pricing in R Studio

This project involved analysing current market conditions (2nd quarter of 2025) and deriving a structured product to hedge against potential recession.

Click [here](https://github.com/godfreychunszeto/Godfrey-ProjectsExperience/blob/main/4.Option_Pricing_Report.pdf) for the report.

Click [here](https://github.com/godfreychunszeto/Godfrey-ProjectsExperience/blob/main/4.Option_Pricing_Code.R) for the simulations done on R Studio.

### 4.1 Key Responsibilities

-   Used Monte Carlo Simulation and Geometric Brownian Motion to simulate SPX fluctuation
-   Designed structured product consisting of call, put and barrier options
-   Priced the structured product in R Studio and analysed its potential return
-   Created a Delta Hedging strategy
-   Wrote a report to aggregate data and findings

### 4.2 Skills Learnt

-   R programming on Monte Carlo Simulation and Geometric Brownian Motion
-   Structuring of complex options
-   Delta hedging

## 5 Research Project: Manufacturing Sustainable PEO Fibres for Healthcare Applications

My final year project at University College London analyses electrodynamic (EHD) technology in the synthesis of polyethylene oxide (PEO) fibres, incorporating ESG, green chemistry and sustainability concerns.

Click [here](https://github.com/godfreychunszeto/Godfrey-ProjectsExperience/blob/main/5.FYP_Sustainable_Polymers.pdf) for the report.

### 5.1 Key Responsibilities

-   Researched on ESG concepts and green chemistry
-   Ran electrodynamic electrospinning experiments
-   Analysed data with SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope)

### 5.2 Skills Learnt

-   ESG applications
-   SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) technology
-   Researching skills (information literacy, critical thinking, data analysis, problem solving)

## 6 Stress Analysis Coursework

This coursework involves the simulation of stress analysis on Autodesk Fusion360 and data aggregation and visualisation on MATLAB.

Click [here](https://github.com/godfreychunszeto/Godfrey-ProjectsExperience/blob/main/6.Stress%20Analysis%20Coursework.pdf) for the report.

### 6.1 Key Responsibilities

-   FE model setup and simulation
-   Interpretation of results on MATLAB

### 6.2 Skills Learnt

-   Operated Autodesk Fusion360
-   Operated MATLAB
